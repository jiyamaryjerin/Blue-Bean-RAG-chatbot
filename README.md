This Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot is designed to help students obtain personalized information about scholarships. The chatbot leverages state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) to provide accurate, context-aware responses. The system integrates technologies such as semantic search and optical character recognition along with models such as nomic-embed-text to create a comprehensive database of scholarship opportunities.  Based on user input, such as educational qualifications, location, financial background and fields of interest relevant information is retrieved. This retrieved information is then processed by the llama 3.2 model to deliver precise and user-friendly responses. The chatbot aims to bridge the information gap by simplifying access to relevant scholarship details, ensuring inclusivity and accessibility for diverse user groups, particularly students from underserved communities. This solution has the potential to reduce barriers in education by empowering students with timely and relevant scholarship opportunities.
